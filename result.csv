Given that nursing is a practice-based profession, we believe that clinical experience is a vital and integral component of the curriculum, providing students with hands-on opportunities to actively apply classroom learning to ‘real life’ nursing practice under the supervision and support of a clinical teacher. Clinical Instructors (CIs) play an important role in facilitating student learning to further develop students’ knowledge, skill, and judgement. CIs are expected to support both students and preceptors in placements. CIs should be flexible and prepared to utilize additional learning modalities such as simulation and virtual clinical learning in the event a clinical day is cancelled by the organization. CIs will work closely with the Clinical Education Office and Course Faculty to develop and share resources to support the continuity of clinical teaching and student learning. CIs are required to complete all on-boarding and orientation activities required by the faculty as well as the clinical placement site prior to the start of the placement in preparation for their clinical teaching role. Ongoing support will be provided throughout the term by Course Faculty, the Undergraduate Clinical Resource Faculty, and the Clinical Education Office.  Applicants should note that commitment to the role for the entire term is needed for consistency in the development, assessment, and evaluation of nursing students.

6. Facilitate an in-person four hours community simulation (dates/times to be confirmed).

10. Prepare for and facilitate a weekly online, synchronous two-hour clinical discussion with the students, reflecting on virtual case scenarios completed by the students and building on existing clinical experiences.  
11. Monitor student performance and assess student progress with meeting the clinical practice expectations for the course.   
12. Participate in weekly email communication with Course Faculty and provide a brief update and / or identify any concerns about students’ experiences and clinical progress.  
13. Ensure ongoing communication with students, preceptors, and course faculty.
