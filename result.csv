To help students with these qualifying exams, Rotman has provided reference materials and access to an online platform to write the exam. The incoming class may require some support as they prepare to write the prerequisite exams.

Questions will come to the incumbent on an irregular schedule, based on student need. While the work will begin in May, a higher volume of enquiries is expected in June, when most students write the exams. The service delivery expectation is for enquiries to receive responses within 2 calendar days.
