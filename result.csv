Given that nursing is a practice-based profession, we believe that clinical experience is a vital and integral component of the curriculum, providing students with hands-on opportunities to actively apply classroom learning to ‘real life’ nursing practice under the supervision and support of a clinical teacher. Clinical Instructors (CIs) play an important role in facilitating student learning to further develop students’ knowledge, skill, and judgement. CIs are expected to support both students and preceptors in placements. CIs should be flexible and prepared to utilize additional learning modalities such as simulation and virtual clinical learning in the event a clinical day is cancelled by the organization. CIs will work closely with the Clinical Education Office and Course Faculty to develop and share resources to support the continuity of clinical teaching and student learning. CIs are required to complete all on-boarding and orientation activities required by the faculty as well as the clinical placement site prior to the start of the placement in preparation for their clinical teaching role. Ongoing support will be provided throughout the term by Course Faculty, the Undergraduate Clinical Resource Faculty, and the Clinical Education Office.

Given that nursing is a practice-based profession, we believe that clinical experience is a vital and integral component of the curriculum, providing students with hands-on opportunities to actively apply classroom learning to ‘real life’ nursing practice under the supervision and support of a clinical teacher. Clinical Instructors (CIs) play an important role in facilitating student learning and providing excellent clinical learning experiences to further develop students’ knowledge, skill, and judgement. 
	
CIs should be flexible and prepared to utilize additional learning modalities such as simulation and virtual clinical learning in the event a clinical day is cancelled by the organization. CIs will work closely with the Clinical Education Office and Course Faculty to develop and share resources to support the continuity of clinical teaching and student learning. CIs are required to complete all on-boarding and orientation activities required by the faculty as well as the clinical placement site prior to the start of the placement in preparation for their clinical teaching role. Ongoing support will be provided throughout the term by Course Faculty, the Undergraduate Clinical Resource Faculty, and the Clinical Education Office.  Applicants should note that commitment to the role for the entire term is needed for consistency in the development, assessment, and evaluation of nursing students.                                             Duties and Responsibilities:                1.	Complete the asynchronous CI orientation learning modules as required and attend the in-person Faculty-led CI orientation for NUR361. 
2.	Complete all on-boarding and orientation required by the University as well as the clinical placement site prior to the first clinical shift. 
3.	Familiarize themselves with and uphold all faculty and University policies related to clinical placements (e.g., CI and Student Absences, Professional Behaviour). 
4.	Prepare patient assignments prior to students’ arrival on the nursing unit, reflective of the students’ level of expertise.
5.	Facilitate students’ application of theory related to foundational therapeutic, relational, and health assessment skills.
o	Note: Students are expected to apply learning from the classroom and lab settings each week during their clinical shifts. This is done through practising the learned assessments and skills as part of the nursing care provided, as well as engaging in active discussion with the CI and clinical group.
6.	Assist with and assess the students’ preparation for their clinical activities with attention to integration of nursing, pathophysiological,  and therapeutic concepts.
7.	Encourage an inquiring, theory, and evidence-informed approach to nursing practice.
8.	Facilitate interprofessional and intraprofessional communication among students and all members of the health care team.
9.	Directly supervise and assist students as they relate to and provide care for patients, while also monitoring and assessing students’ progress with meeting the clinical practice expectations. 
10.	Collaborate with nursing staff in gaining assistance and access to learning experiences for the students.
11.	Foster reflection and critical discussion about clinical learning among students during conferences.
12.	Participate in weekly email communication with Course Faculty and provide a brief update and/or identify any concerns about students’ experiences and clinical progress. 
13.	Provide students with ongoing verbal feedback about their progress with meeting the clinical practice expectations for the course.
14.	Provide a written final online evaluation incorporating feedback from all clinical shifts.
15.	Arrange and facilitate a short 1:1 virtual meeting to review each students’ final evaluation within a week of the final clinical shift.",Previous experience is the more relevant criterion than the need to acquire experience in respect of this posted position.,40,,"""Qualifications:
1. Interest in clinical teaching and working with novice nursing students.
2. Minimum of 2-3 years of current and relevant clinical experience (Mental Health nursing).

Additional duties may be required as directed by the Course Coordinator (if applicable), the Undergraduate Administrator or the Associate Chair, Undergraduate.
 
If there is no designated coordinator, there is an expectation that the different sections of a multi-section course will function similarly: they will normally have the same syllabus and assessment plan, and will have common midterm exams and final exam. Problem sets and quizzes should be common, or at least similar/interchangeable, and should operate at a similar level with a similar approach.  In addition, all instructors are expected to work together with the other instructors in the course and to collaborate in creating the syllabus, determining the course structure, and creating and marking the final assessment.

The principal focus of this course is the complex engagement of literature and the arts with both colonial and neo-colonial encounters between, Europe, Africa and the Americas over the last five hundred years. Exploring world cultures through the prism of colonial encounters facilitates discussions about the genesis of contemporary politics of globalisation as well as the accompanying dynamics of exploitation and resistance. This approach will also help to elucidate the ways in which contact between different world zones have been pivotal in the development of new national and regional cultures. In the process we engage with a wide range of questions including environmental precarity, food security, cultural violence, religious alterity, revolutions, and the coming of age of new subjectivities.   The material to be discussed will be organized under four broad headings: The Columbian Exchange in Cinema and Art; Colonial Encounters and Latin American Politics of Identity; Fictions of Colonial Encounters in West Africa; Narratives of Colonial and Neo-Colonial Encounters in the Caribbean.

This includes working with student groups on team formation, brainstorming facilitation, team decision making, and writing during the tutorial sessions. TAs mark several written assignments, a quiz during the term, and the final exam. All TAs are required to attend benchmarking sessions with the Communication Coordinator prior to marking. After marking is completed, the TAs are required to run assignment debriefing sessions with the students when returning marked team assignments. 

In the Winter term, TAs work with a new section of student teams. The student teams develop a full design for an outside client. TAs consult with the teams, help them with the design process, provide counselling on their written work, and mark written assignments. As in the Fall, attendance at assignment benchmarking and debriefing sessions are required in the Winter. 

For both terms, TAs are expected to support invigilating in-person assessments (the Fall quiz and Winter midterm) and provide in-person support during help sessions held occasionally during lecture. 

Tutorials for Fall and Winter are planned to be in-person, unless there are changes to health policies that prevent in-person course delivery. Any changes to the course delivery (in-person, online, or a hybrid of both), will be communicated by the University at a later date. 

In both terms, there are mandatory weekly teaching team meetings on Mondays 10 am-11 am with approximately 70 teaching team members (Administrative Staff, Coordinators, Lecturers, Communication Instructors, Engineering Managers, TAs, etc.) to discuss how the previous week went, what is planned for the following week, what is being covered in lectures, and discuss any problems that may have arisen. These meetings are in-person and attendance is mandatory.  

There will be paid in-person mandatory TA training sessions at the end of August/beginning of September.
