They must also attend regular weekly meeting(s), as well as several additional meetings (to be scheduled at the beginning of the term) related to grading assignments. To support these varied activities, course-specific training will be offered in the fall.
Studios (2-hour tutorial and practical blocks consisting of approximately 24 students which meet twice weekly) mainly involve activities related to engineering design, and help students build skills around effective teamwork, project management, understanding unfamiliar design contexts and stakeholders, technical design and prototyping, and communication. For technical design and prototyping, TAs will also facilitate interactions between students and course partners such as the Myhal Fabrication Facility during studio: https://uoft.me/myfab. In addition, TAs will give feedback on (asynchronously) and approve student orders for parts and services from the Fabrication Facility outside of studio time. 
Each TA is expected to support one or two studio sections. There is some flexibility in exactly which section(s) you are assigned to accommodate your availability, but you will have to be available for both meeting times for your assigned section(s) each week. 
In addition to leading studio sessions, TAs will assess oral presentations (during studio) as well as written and other multi-media student work, including CAD models, sketches, videos and photographs of mechatronic systems, circuit diagrams, functional block diagrams, project management documentation, and other design-relevant artifacts. As part of all assessments, TAs are expected to provide constructive, actionable feedback to students to help them improve from deliverable to deliverable.
All TAs are also required to attend weekly course team meetings (two per week for the first six weeks, and one per week thereafter). Weekly course team meetings will include a debrief of the previous week’s studio activities, plans for the following week’s studio activities, lecture content overviews, and discussion of any problems that may have arisen. Meetings will be held in hybrid format with in-person attendance required except by prior arrangement. In addition, you will be required to attend (at least) one hour of lecture per week to assist students with hands-on teamwork and active learning activities during lecture.
TAs will be supported by faculty co-leads, an engineering communication instructor, and will work together to share duties relating to course logistics as part of a large, tight-knit TA team.
Studio sessions, meetings and lectures are planned to be held in-person, unless there are changes to health policies that prevent in-person course delivery. Lectures will be delivered in hybrid format for accommodation reasons; however, you must attend lecture in-person at least once per week. Any changes to the course delivery (in-person, online, or a hybrid of both), will be communicated by the University at a later date.

Assessement and Feedback TAs also provide support to students in lecture(s) during the first three weeks of the course which focus on hands-on prototyping skill building. 

This role is different from a more traditional grading role because of the design-centered nature of the course. The course content is related to engineering design and helps students build skills around effective teamwork, project management, understanding non-familiar design contexts and stakeholders, technical design and prototyping, and communication. Students produce artifacts for assessment and feedback related to their design process, design outputs, and individual reflections and analysis of the design experience. For the Assessment and Feedback role in this course, the main focus will be on providing feedback regarding reflective practice, though you will also grade some technical deliverables; therefore, assessment and Feedback TAs are expected to be familiar with all aspects of the student experience in the course.

Assessment and Feedback TAs are expected to attend benchmarking meetings for each assessment to align expectations. Meetings will be held in hybrid format with in-person attendance preferred (unless previously arranged). 

The course uses a set of tools for assessment that have been developed in-house. TAs will have to learn and be comfortable with these tools. The tools are designed to make assessment easier, especially in terms of collaborating with others on assessment and tracking progress. 

To familiarize themselves with the student experience, all Assessment and Feedback TAs are required to complete all components of the Myhal Fabrication Facility Safety Training (Tier-1 and Tier-2): https://uoft.me/myfabsafety.

The course title is inspired by Gregory Bateson’s “ecology of mind” theory, which views the psyche as part of a relational network with the material world that, like biological ecosystems, will interact, adapt and evolve over time. Students will uncover how natural settings enhance sense of security, curiosity, connectedness and clarity, and how nature enhances systems thinking when we attend to its patterns of relationship. Students will understand and experience nature-based systems thinking that inspires more relational, interconnected and process-oriented perception. The course will highlight the psychological losses associated with environmental degradation, and how the benefits of above can be enhanced through nature-based mindfulness and collective environmental engagement.

The projects available will range across the social and biophysical sciences; for example, experiments with agroecology and regenerative food systems, or engagement with food sovereignty movements and local food policies. Students will also have opportunities to reflect on the role of experiential learning, interdisciplinary community-engaged research, and action in effecting positive social and ecological change.","Experience (a) with research in critical food studies from interdisciplinary perspectives, (b) growing food, and (c) working with community partners and diverse social organizations an asset.",$51.93/hour + 4% vacation pay fall 2024; $52.97/hour + 4% vacation pay for winter 2025,,"Thursday, 12 - 1"

Many are developing strong operational sustainability goals and targets, and are giving increasing emphasis to teaching and research on sustainability issues. Yet few have committed at the executive level to integrating academic and operational sustainability in the context of treating their campus as a living laboratory of sustainable practice, research and teaching. This course will explore and apply the living lab concept, in the context of operational sustainability at the University of Toronto. We will begin by looking at the literature on university sustainability and the living lab concept. The bulk of the course will involve undertaking an applied research project on some aspect of campus sustainability, working in close partnership with operational staff at the University of Toronto. Students will develop the skills needed to work across disciplines and fields of study, and with non-academic partners. This course will put students to work on operational sustainability projects identified by the staff working in or with the Sustainability Office at the University of Toronto. Students will be organized into groups, each of which will be assigned one project, to be overseen by one or more U of T staff members. The bulk of the course will consist of regular meetings with the staff “clients”, with instructors, and in small groups to undertake a group project. A crucial aspect of this course is the ability of students to work collaboratively together in a group environment, and to work effectively with a university staff person acting as a “client” for their work.",Previous work experience in the sustainability field with different types of organizations is an asset.,$51.93/hour + 4% vacation pay,,Lecture/practical Tuesday 1 - 3
