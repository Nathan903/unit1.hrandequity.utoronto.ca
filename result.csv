Assessement Only TAs support grading for both technical and reflective deliverables in the course.

This role is different from a more traditional grading role because of the design-centered nature of the course. The course content is related to engineering design and helps students build skills around effective teamwork, project management, understanding non-familiar design contexts and stakeholders, technical design and prototyping, and communication. Students produce artifacts for assessment and feedback related to their design process, design outputs, and individual reflections and analysis of the design experience. For the Assessment Only role in this course, the main focus will be on providing feedback regarding reflective practice, though you will also grade some technical deliverables; therefore, assessment and Feedback TAs are expected to be familiar with all aspects of the student experience in the course.

Assessment and Feedback TAs are expected to attend benchmarking meetings for each assessment to align expectations. Meetings will be held in hybrid format with in-person attendance preferred (unless previously arranged). 

The course uses a set of tools for assessment that have been developed in-house. TAs will have to learn and be comfortable with these tools. The tools are designed to make assessment easier, especially in terms of collaborating with others on assessment and tracking progress. 

To familiarize themselves with the student experience, all Assessment and Feedback TAs are required to complete all components of the Myhal Fabrication Facility Safety Training (Tier-1 and Tier-2): https://uoft.me/myfabsafety.
