The principal focus of this course is the complex engagement of literature and the arts with both colonial and neo-colonial encounters between, Europe, Africa and the Americas over the last five hundred years. Exploring world cultures through the prism of colonial encounters facilitates discussions about the genesis of contemporary politics of globalisation as well as the accompanying dynamics of exploitation and resistance. This approach will also help to elucidate the ways in which contact between different world zones have been pivotal in the development of new national and regional cultures. In the process we engage with a wide range of questions including environmental precarity, food security, cultural violence, religious alterity, revolutions, and the coming of age of new subjectivities.   The material to be discussed will be organized under four broad headings: The Columbian Exchange in Cinema and Art; Colonial Encounters and Latin American Politics of Identity; Fictions of Colonial Encounters in West Africa; Narratives of Colonial and Neo-Colonial Encounters in the Caribbean.
