The courses reflect the program’s defining theme, “learning without borders,” by exploring a locally relevant issue through a transnational lens, building students’ capacities as critically reflective learners, emphasizing creative pedagogy and interdisciplinarity, engaging the perspectives of community members and senior students; and fostering student development overall.

NEW106H1F: How can scientific knowledge and research be mobilized to impact individual and global health? How is health impacted by social, racial and economic inequalities? This course explores scientific research and practice with special attention to the translation of scientific knowledge in the public sphere, and its ability to inform policies, practices and laws. Students have the opportunity to meet with clinician-scientists, policy-makers, and other professionals connected to the health care system.

NEW116H1S: What is the role of science in addressing current global threats? What are the possibilities and the limitations of scientific research and knowledge in tackling complex problems such as climate change, pandemics and pollution? In this course, students explore these questions by examining case studies, meeting with specialists in various scientific fields, and engaging in research on a topic of their own choice.

New One courses meet for 3 hours each week.  A portion of those sessions will occasionally be allocated to “Learning Labs.”  All students in the program come together in these Learning Labs to engage in joint activities and explore issues that are common to the four topics.   Both in seminars and Learning Labs, students will experience a variety of ways of learning (through, for example, guest lectures, group work, workshops, field trips to local community organizations, and panels of senior students sharing their experience and insights).

They must also attend regular weekly meeting(s), as well as several additional meetings (to be scheduled at the beginning of the term) related to grading assignments. To support these varied activities, course-specific training will be offered in the fall.

Studios (2-hour tutorial and practical blocks consisting of approximately 24 students which meet twice weekly) mainly involve activities related to engineering design, and help students build skills around effective teamwork, project management, understanding unfamiliar design contexts and stakeholders, technical design and prototyping, and communication. For technical design and prototyping, TAs will also facilitate interactions between students and course partners such as the Myhal Fabrication Facility during studio: https://uoft.me/myfab. In addition, TAs will give feedback on (asynchronously) and approve student orders for parts and services from the Fabrication Facility outside of studio time. 

Each TA is expected to support one or two studio sections. There is some flexibility in exactly which section(s) you are assigned to accommodate your availability, but you will have to be available for both meeting times for your assigned section(s) each week. In addition to leading studio sessions, TAs will assess oral presentations (during studio) as well as written and other multi-media student work, including CAD models, sketches, videos and photographs of mechatronic systems, circuit diagrams, functional block diagrams, project management documentation, and other design-relevant artifacts. As part of all assessments, TAs are expected to provide constructive, actionable feedback to students to help them improve from deliverable to deliverable.

All TAs are also required to attend weekly course team meetings (two per week for the first six weeks, and one per week thereafter). Weekly course team meetings will include a debrief of the previous week’s studio activities, plans for the following week’s studio activities, lecture content overviews, and discussion of any problems that may have arisen. Meetings will be held in hybrid format with in-person attendance required except by prior arrangement. In addition, you will be required to attend about one hour of lecture per week to assist students with hands-on teamwork and active learning activities during lecture, and/or hold ""Prototyping Support Hours"" in the Myhal Light Fabrication Facility to support ongoing prototyping work.

TAs will be supported by faculty co-leads, an engineering communication instructor, and will work together to share duties relating to course logistics as part of a large, tight-knit TA team.

Studio sessions, meetings and lectures are planned to be held in-person, unless there are changes to health policies that prevent in-person course delivery. Lectures will be delivered in hybrid format for accommodation reasons; however, you must plan to attend lecture in-person about once per week as needed to support active learning. Any changes to the course delivery (in-person, online, or a hybrid of both), will be communicated by the University at a later date.

This role is different from a more traditional grading role because of the design-centered nature of the course. The course content is related to engineering design and helps students build skills around effective teamwork, project management, understanding non-familiar design contexts and stakeholders, technical design and prototyping, and communication. Students produce artifacts for assessment and feedback related to their design process, design outputs, and individual reflections and analysis of the design experience. For the Assessment and Feedback role in this course, the main focus will be on providing feedback regarding reflective practice, though you will also grade some technical deliverables; therefore, assessment and Feedback TAs are expected to be familiar with all aspects of the student experience in the course. 
 
Assessment and Feedback TAs are expected to attend benchmarking meetings for each assessment to align expectations. Meetings will be held in hybrid format with in-person attendance required (unless previously arranged).

This position will start in September 2025 and will continue through the end of April 2026. This is a specialist position; in it, the successful applicant will lead the QT—Write Ins, a group open to the New College 2SLGBTQ+ community and allies and one of the New College Writing Centre’s (NCWC) inclusive spaces. This group provides writing welcome for students as they create their writing assignments and personal creative projects during the Fall and Winter terms. This position will be at least 100 hours; administrative duties as well as teaching will be important in this role. The successful applicant will also teach in the one-on-one program in the NCWC and may also create writing workshops. Applicants should be prepared to teach both in-person and online.  The person in this role will liaise with various student services in the New College context to deliver innovative programing. 

The context: 
New College is a large undergraduate college at the University of Toronto, with a strong focus on social justice and community engagement. Home to a culturally and linguistically diverse student body, New College also houses the highest percentage of international students of any U of T college. Our innovative, interdisciplinary academic programs—African Studies, Critical Solidarity and Equity Studies, and Buddhist Psychology and Mental Health—seek to promote social responsibility, diversity, critical equity and global awareness.   
The New College Writing Centre offers skilled, sensitive and welcoming writing instruction designed to enable students to realize their full potential as learners and contributors to knowledge production—in their fields of study, in the wider community, and in professional life. Our approach to writing instruction emphasizes writing as a complex ability that is continuously learned and relearned in relation to changing contexts and purposes. We value the linguistic diversity that students bring to their writing. 
This writing teaching assistant position will involve providing one-to-one writing instruction to undergraduate students working in a variety of disciplines, including academic programs housed at New College (http://www.newcollege.utoronto.ca/academics/new-collegeacademic-programs/); additional writing instruction in drop-in writing communities as well as writing workshops may also be included. The teaching assistant will provide instruction in critical analysis, critical reading, modes of argument, research skills, and methods for drafting and revising texts and for preparing oral presentations. 
The New College Writing Centre works with students enrolled in our academic programs in addition to students registered at New College who are taking Arts & Science courses more broadly. We encourage applicants who are reflective about the role of faculty in welcoming and mentoring a diverse range of students.

The courses reflect the program’s defining theme, “learning without borders,” by exploring a locally relevant issue through a transnational lens, building students’ capacities as critically reflective learners, emphasizing creative pedagogy and interdisciplinarity, engaging the perspectives of community members and senior students; and fostering student development overall.

NEW106H1F: How can scientific knowledge and research be mobilized to impact individual and global health? How is health impacted by social, racial and economic inequalities? This course explores scientific research and practice with special attention to the translation of scientific knowledge in the public sphere, and its ability to inform policies, practices and laws. Students have the opportunity to meet with clinician-scientists, policy-makers, and other professionals connected to the health care system.

NEW116H1S: What is the role of science in addressing current global threats? What are the possibilities and the limitations of scientific research and knowledge in tackling complex problems such as climate change, pandemics and pollution? In this course, students explore these questions by examining case studies, meeting with specialists in various scientific fields, and engaging in research on a topic of their own choice.

New One courses meet for 3 hours each week.  A portion of those sessions will occasionally be allocated to “Learning Labs.”  All students in the program come together in these Learning Labs to engage in joint activities and explore issues that are common to the four topics.   Both in seminars and Learning Labs, students will experience a variety of ways of learning (through, for example, guest lectures, group work, workshops, field trips to local community organizations, and panels of senior students sharing their experience and insights).

Given that nursing is a practice-based profession, we believe that clinical experience is a vital and integral component of the curriculum, providing students with hands-on opportunities to actively apply classroom learning to ‘real life’ nursing practice under the supervision and support of a clinical teacher. Clinical Instructors (CIs) play an important role in facilitating student learning to further develop students’ knowledge, skill, and judgement. CIs are expected to support both students and preceptors in placements. CIs should be flexible and prepared to utilize additional learning modalities such as simulation and virtual clinical learning in the event a clinical day is cancelled by the organization. CIs will work closely with the Clinical Education Office and Course Faculty to develop and share resources to support the continuity of clinical teaching and student learning. CIs are required to complete all on-boarding and orientation activities required by the faculty as well as the clinical placement site prior to the start of the placement in preparation for their clinical teaching role. Ongoing support will be provided throughout the term by Course Faculty, the Undergraduate Clinical Resource Faculty, and the Clinical Education Office.
