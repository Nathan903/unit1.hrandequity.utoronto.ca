to principles and practice of whole-genome sequencing. During the course, student
teams sequence an entire eukaryotic genome and analyze it. Topics taught include: modern
sequencing technology, yeast husbandry, genomic library construction and quality control,
‘next-generation’ sequencing, sequence assembly using a reference genome, principles of
genome organization, mutation detection and interpretation. The work includes both “wet”
lab components during the first half of the course and computational analysis (online) for
the last few weeks of the course.

The course is structured as a weekly three-hour laboratory session each Tuesday from 1-4 pm
throughout the winter semester. Most sessions will be approximately one hour of
lecture/discussion led by the instructor and two hours of hands on lab work. Some lab sessions
will go a bit longer. The instructor is expected to attend all lab sessions, help prepare the lab
beforehand, and to answer student questions. The approximate time commitment is 8 hours per
week.

The course identifies sources beyond “luck” that explain why firms with the same opportunities can nonetheless perform so differently.  Among other topics, the course explores: 1. Why certain strategic choices fit together better than others. 2. How industries shape firm performance. 3. The strategies firms pursue to create and capture value. 4. When firms should grow, shrink, or expand in scope. 5. How firms pursue innovation. 6. How firms motivate workers, managers, and suppliers. Throughout the semester students will read a combination of academic papers, practitioner articles, and case studies, exploring these themes and topics. The ultimate goal of the course is to improve students' decision-making and critical thinking capabilities through learning and applying strategy tools and through active discussion and debate with peers. The emphasis of the course, and particularly of class discussion, is on rigorous thinking and learning rather than finding the “right” answer.

Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing Program provides a full-time, two-year, second entry baccalaureate nursing education. Given that nursing is a practice-based profession, we believe that clinical experience is a vital and integral component of the curriculum, providing students with hands-on opportunities to actively apply classroom learning to ‘real life’ nursing practice under the supervision and support of a clinical teacher. Clinical Instructors (CIs) play an important role in facilitating student learning and providing excellent clinical learning experiences to further develop students’ knowledge, skill, and judgement. 

CIs should be flexible and prepared to utilize additional learning modalities such as simulation and virtual clinical learning in the event a clinical day is cancelled by the organization. CIs will work closely with the Clinical Education Office and Course Faculty to develop and share resources to support the continuity of clinical teaching and student learning. CIs are required to complete all on-boarding and orientation activities required by the faculty as well as the clinical placement site prior to the start of the placement in preparation for their clinical teaching role. Ongoing support will be provided throughout the term by Course Faculty, the Undergraduate Clinical Resource Faculty, and the Clinical Education Office.  Applicants should note that commitment to the role for the entire term is needed for consistency in the development, assessment, and evaluation of nursing students. 

Duties and Responsibilities:
1.	 Complete the asynchronous CI orientation learning modules as required and attend the in-person Faculty-led CI orientation for NUR371. 
2.	Complete all on-boarding and orientation required by the University as well as the clinical placement site prior to the first clinical shift.
3.	Familiarize themselves with and uphold all faculty and University policies related to clinical placements (e.g., CI and Student Absences, Professional Behaviour). 
4.	 Prepare patient assignments prior to students' arrival on the nursing unit, reflective of the students' level of expertise.
5.	Actively facilitate students’ application of theory related therapeutic (e.g., health assessment, various nursing interventions, such as medication administration and IV management) and relational skills (e.g., therapeutic relationships).
6.	Assist with and assess the students' preparation for their clinical activities with attention to integration of nursing, pathophysiological, pharmacologic and therapeutic concepts.
7.	Encourage an inquiring, theory and evidence-informed approach to nursing practice.
8.	Facilitate interprofessional communication among students and all members of the health care team.
9.	Supervise and monitor student progress and safety when performing therapeutic practice skills.
10.	Collaborate with nursing staff in gaining assistance and access to learning experiences for the students.
