They must also attend regular weekly meeting(s), as well as several additional meetings (to be scheduled at the beginning of the term) related to grading assignments. To support these varied activities, course-specific training will be offered in December 2025.

Studios (2-hour tutorial and practical blocks consisting of approximately 24 students which meet twice weekly) mainly involve activities related to engineering design, and help students build skills around effective teamwork, project management, understanding unfamiliar design contexts and stakeholders, technical design and prototyping, and communication. For technical design and prototyping, TAs will also facilitate interactions between students and course partners such as the Myhal Fabrication Facility during studio: https://uoft.me/myfab. In addition, TAs will give feedback on (asynchronously) and approve student orders for parts and services from the Fabrication Facility outside of studio time. 

Each TA is expected to support one or two studio sections. There is some flexibility in exactly which section(s) you are assigned to accommodate your availability, but you will have to be available for both meeting times for your assigned section(s) each week. In addition to leading studio sessions, TAs will assess oral presentations (during studio) as well as written and other multi-media student work, including CAD models, sketches, videos and photographs of mechatronic systems, circuit diagrams, functional block diagrams, project management documentation, and other design-relevant artifacts. As part of all assessments, TAs are expected to provide constructive, actionable feedback to students to help them improve from deliverable to deliverable.

All TAs are also required to attend weekly course team meetings (two per week for the first six weeks, and one per week thereafter). Weekly course team meetings will include a debrief of the previous week’s studio activities, plans for the following week’s studio activities, lecture content overviews, and discussion of any problems that may have arisen. Meetings will be held in hybrid format with in-person attendance required except by prior arrangement. In addition, you will be required to attend some lectures to assist students with hands-on teamwork and active learning activities during lecture, and/or hold ""Prototyping Support Hours"" in the Myhal Light Fabrication Facility to support ongoing prototyping work.

TAs will be supported by faculty co-leads, an engineering communication instructor, and will work together to share duties relating to course logistics as part of a large, tight-knit TA team.

Studio sessions, meetings and lectures are planned to be held in-person, unless there are changes to health policies that prevent in-person course delivery. Lectures will be delivered in hybrid format for accommodation reasons; however, you must plan to attend lecture in-person as needed to support active learning. Any changes to the course delivery (in-person, online, or a hybrid of both), will be communicated by the University at a later date.
