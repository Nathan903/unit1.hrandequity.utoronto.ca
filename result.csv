Our innovative, interdisciplinary academic programs—African Studies, Critical Solidarity and Equity Studies, and Buddhist Psychology and Mental Health—seek to promote social responsibility, diversity, critical equity and global awareness.   
The New College Writing Centre offers skilled, sensitive and welcoming writing instruction designed to enable students to realize their full potential as learners and contributors to knowledge production—in their fields of study, in the wider community, and in professional life. Our approach to writing instruction emphasizes writing as a complex ability that is continuously learned and relearned in relation to changing contexts and purposes. We value the linguistic diversity that students bring to their writing.

The teaching assistant will provide instruction in critical analysis, critical reading, modes of argument, research skills, and methods for drafting and revising texts and for preparing oral presentations. 
The New College Writing Centre works with students enrolled in our academic programs in addition to students registered at New College who are taking Arts & Science courses more broadly.

Given that nursing is a practice-based profession, we believe that clinical experience is a vital and integral component of the curriculum, providing students with hands-on opportunities to actively apply classroom learning to ‘real life’ nursing practice under the supervision and support of a clinical teacher. Clinical Instructors (CIs) play an important role in facilitating student learning and providing excellent clinical learning experiences to further develop students’ knowledge, skill, and judgement. 
	
CIs should be flexible and prepared to utilize additional learning modalities such as simulation and virtual clinical learning in the event a clinical day is cancelled by the organization. CIs will work closely with the Clinical Education Office and Course Faculty to develop and share resources to support the continuity of clinical teaching and student learning. CIs are required to complete all on-boarding and orientation activities required by the faculty as well as the clinical placement site prior to the start of the placement in preparation for their clinical teaching role. Ongoing support will be provided throughout the term by Course Faculty, the Undergraduate Clinical Resource Faculty, and the Clinical Education Office.

The courses reflect the program’s defining theme, “learning without borders,” by exploring a locally relevant issue through a transnational lens, building students’ capacities as critically reflective learners, emphasizing creative pedagogy and interdisciplinarity, engaging the perspectives of community members and senior students; and fostering student development overall.

NEW106H1F: How can scientific knowledge and research be mobilized to impact individual and global health? How is health impacted by social, racial and economic inequalities? This course explores scientific research and practice with special attention to the translation of scientific knowledge in the public sphere, and its ability to inform policies, practices and laws. Students have the opportunity to meet with clinician-scientists, policy-makers, and other professionals connected to the health care system.

NEW116H1S: What is the role of science in addressing current global threats? What are the possibilities and the limitations of scientific research and knowledge in tackling complex problems such as climate change, pandemics and pollution? In this course, students explore these questions by examining case studies, meeting with specialists in various scientific fields, and engaging in research on a topic of their own choice.

New One courses meet for 3 hours each week.  A portion of those sessions will occasionally be allocated to “Learning Labs.”  All students in the program come together in these Learning Labs to engage in joint activities and explore issues that are common to the four topics.   Both in seminars and Learning Labs, students will experience a variety of ways of learning (through, for example, guest lectures, group work, workshops, field trips to local community organizations, and panels of senior students sharing their experience and insights).

Demonstrated knowledge of critical and literary Theory relevant to the course.  Scholarly expertise relevant to the course material (as shown, for example, by dissertation research). The principal focus of this course is the complex engagement of literature and the arts with both colonial and neo-colonial encounters between, Europe, Africa and the Americas over the last five hundred years. Exploring world cultures through the prism of colonial encounters facilitates discussions about the genesis of contemporary politics of globalisation as well as the accompanying dynamics of exploitation and resistance. This approach will also help to elucidate the ways in which contact between different world zones have been pivotal in the development of new national and regional cultures. In the process we engage with a wide range of questions including environmental precarity, food security, cultural violence, religious alterity, revolutions, and the coming of age of new subjectivities.   The material to be discussed will be organized under four broad headings: The Columbian Exchange in Cinema and Art; Colonial Encounters and Latin American Politics of Identity; Fictions of Colonial Encounters in West Africa; Narratives of Colonial and Neo-Colonial Encounters in the Caribbean.
