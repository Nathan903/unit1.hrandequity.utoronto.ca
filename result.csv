This course examines the U.S. empire as a way of life through Black political thought from the mid-20th century to the present. It specifically focuses on the works of political prisoners, presidential advisors, educators, activists, and journalists, grappling with Black scholarship’s often diverging, overlapping, and contradictory perspectives concerning the U.S. empire. Through collective discussions, writing, and journaling, we engage with visions and strategies of emancipation as an intentional mediation on multiple forms of literature related to understanding racialization, gender, sexuality, ability, and asymmetrical relations of power, which are complex and evolving.

This graduate seminar examines the burgeoning multidisciplinary fields of timbre and orchestration studies. Throughout the seminar, we survey theoretical, analytical, historical, cultural, perceptual, and material orientations to timbre, the practice and study of orchestration, and the interpretation of orchestral music. Sample topics include: Theorizing Orchestral Sonority and Texture, Perceptual Considerations, Global Approaches to Orchestration, Analytical Techniques, Timbre Semantics, Orchestration Treatises, and Ecologies of Production. Course requirements center around short reviews and weekly discussions of readings and musical works, culminating in an independent research project that each student will design in consultation with the instructor. As multidisciplinary meeting points, timbre and orchestration studies stress dialogue between the various branches of music production and scholarship, and as such, students from a wide array of music disciplines are welcome in this course."
