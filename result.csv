Given that nursing is a practice-based profession, we believe that clinical experience is a vital and integral component of the curriculum, providing students with hands-on opportunities to actively apply classroom learning to ‘real life’ nursing practice under the supervision and support of a clinical teacher. Clinical Instructors (CIs) play an important role in facilitating student learning to further develop students’ knowledge, skill, and judgement. CIs are expected to support both students and preceptors in placements. CIs should be flexible and prepared to utilize additional learning modalities such as simulation and virtual clinical learning in the event a clinical day is cancelled by the organization. CIs will work closely with the Clinical Education Office and Course Faculty to develop and share resources to support the continuity of clinical teaching and student learning. CIs are required to complete all on-boarding and orientation activities required by the faculty as well as the clinical placement site prior to the start of the placement in preparation for their clinical teaching role. Ongoing support will be provided throughout the term by Course Faculty, the Undergraduate Clinical Resource Faculty, and the Clinical Education Office.  Applicants should note that commitment to the role for the entire term is needed for consistency in the development, assessment, and evaluation of nursing students.
