This includes working with student groups on team formation, brainstorming facilitation, team decision making, and writing during the tutorial sessions. TAs mark several written assignments, a quiz during the term, and the final exam. All TAs are required to attend benchmarking sessions with the Communication Coordinator prior to marking. After marking is completed, the TAs are required to run assignment debriefing sessions with the students when returning marked team assignments. 

In the Winter term, TAs work with a new section of student teams. The student teams develop a full design for an outside client. TAs consult with the teams, help them with the design process, provide counselling on their written work, and mark written assignments. As in the Fall, attendance at assignment benchmarking and debriefing sessions are required in the Winter. 

For both terms, TAs are expected to support invigilating in-person assessments (the Fall quiz and Winter midterm) and provide in-person support during help sessions held occasionally during lecture. 

Tutorials for Fall and Winter are planned to be in-person, unless there are changes to health policies that prevent in-person course delivery. Any changes to the course delivery (in-person, online, or a hybrid of both), will be communicated by the University at a later date. 

In both terms, there are mandatory weekly teaching team meetings on Mondays 10 am-11 am with approximately 70 teaching team members (Administrative Staff, Coordinators, Lecturers, Communication Instructors, Engineering Managers, TAs, etc.) to discuss how the previous week went, what is planned for the following week, what is being covered in lectures, and discuss any problems that may have arisen. These meetings are in-person and attendance is mandatory.  

There will be paid in-person mandatory TA training sessions at the end of August/beginning of September.
