The course begins by suggesting 10 ""big ideas"" that are fundamental to understanding energy issues; these ideas form a thematic framework for course material. The course then covers energy markets, their successes and failures -- and outlines basic remedies for the latter. It discusses how energy security has shaped world politics in the 20th and 21st centuries. It then proceeds to analyze regulatory institutions, their design, efficiency and efficacy.

Assessement and Feedback TAs also provide support to students in lecture(s) during the first three weeks of the course which focus on hands-on prototyping skill building. 

This role is different from a more traditional grading role because of the design-centered nature of the course. The course content is related to engineering design and helps students build skills around effective teamwork, project management, understanding non-familiar design contexts and stakeholders, technical design and prototyping, and communication. Students produce artifacts for assessment and feedback related to their design process, design outputs, and individual reflections and analysis of the design experience. For the Assessment and Feedback role in this course, the main focus will be on providing feedback regarding reflective practice, though you will also grade some technical deliverables; therefore, assessment and Feedback TAs are expected to be familiar with all aspects of the student experience in the course.

Assessment and Feedback TAs are expected to attend benchmarking meetings for each assessment to align expectations. Meetings will be held in hybrid format with in-person attendance preferred (unless previously arranged). 

The course uses a set of tools for assessment that have been developed in-house. TAs will have to learn and be comfortable with these tools. The tools are designed to make assessment easier, especially in terms of collaborating with others on assessment and tracking progress. 

To familiarize themselves with the student experience, all Assessment and Feedback TAs are required to complete all components of the Myhal Fabrication Facility Safety Training (Tier-1 and Tier-2): https://uoft.me/myfabsafety. In addition, there will be course-specific training conducted prior to the start of the winter semester to ensure TAs are adequately prepared to assess the range of deliverables produced by students, and support their hands-on prototyping activities during lecture(s).",Previous experience is the more relevant criterion than the need to acquire experience in respect of this posted position.,~2,,"Open to graduate students who have an APSC B.A.Sc. or equivalent (preferred), and to qualified upper year APSC undergraduate students.","Preference will be given to students who engage in and have a passion for Engineering Design, as well as (1) have experience marking technical and reflective writing, (2) have taken ESC101, ESC102 and ESC204, (3) have been or are currently enrolled in Engineering Science, (4) have taught or assisted in design course(s), (5) have worked on design projects with global/international context, impact or significance, (6) have prior experience with (course-based or from industry) teamwork and project management, (7) have competencies in one or more of the following technical areas (including adapting to new software/tools and navigating documentation/resources within these areas):
