Student teams carry out genetic crosses, mutant hunts, and phenotypic/genotypic characterization in bacteria, phage, and yeast mutants, and learn to analyze, interpret, and present the genetic data obtained.  Students learn fundamental lab skills through experimentation (dilution streaking, cell culturing/counting, sterile technique, pipetting, serial dilutions, crossing strains etc. ) as well as standard genetic approaches including generating mutants, deducing gene function from phenotypic analysis, identifying genetic suppressors, characterizing mutant alleles (both phenotypically and genotypically),  ordering genes in a genetic pathway (epistasis analysis) and generating genetic interaction profiles.  Topics taught encompass the fundamental concepts of genetics: mutation, complementation, recombination, genetic suppression and regulation (epistasis)—and notably, how to apply the tools of genetic analysis, interpret the results and present the data.  While strong emphasis is placed on the “doing of proper genetics”—experimental design, the importance of controls, good lab habits (sterile technique, dilutions, organization and safe handling of all materials) are core learning objectives, as is the effective communication of scientific data through the production of high quality of data figures/tables and clear scientific writing. The model organisms used are Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both biosafety level 1 organisms.  

The MGY314H1F course is team taught in the fall semester (September to December) and consists of 12 weeks of genetics labs, broken up into two distinct parts (prokaryotic vs eukaryotic genetics).  Each section of the course is independently overseen by a separate instructor and run in conjunction with the Department of Teaching Labs who are responsible for the materials required for the wet lab sessions (including the biological and chemical reagents) and provide additional behind the scenes support such as growing cultures, extra replica platings, incubating plates and removing to cold, monitoring experiments for contamination etc. The instructor meets weekly (~1H) with the teaching assistants and DTL prior to each in-lab session (usually Monday or Tuesday) at a mutually convenient time to review the learning objectives for the lab, provide TA training, assess the results from the previous week's experiments and answer any questions about the week's lab (may also be done by email).   The sessional position is predominantly for the first 6 weeks of the course (focusing on bacterial genetics) and culminates in a 1H midterm test that is written and marked by the instructor.  In addition, the instructor contributes questions/marking of the final exam in December, which normally counts for ~20% of the final exam.  
	The overall format of the course is that each week, the instructor posts a 30 to 60 min background lecture on-line (on Mondays) that the students must view prior to attending the wet lab session each Thursday from 1-5 pm.  Student preparedness for the lab is assessed through existing on-line quizzes due before the wet lab starts.  As the background lecture counts as part of the 4H weekly lab course time allotment, most students will complete the in-lab portion of the course within 3H, however some lab sessions will go a bit longer.  The instructor is expected to attend all lab sessions, answer student questions, help prepare the lab beforehand, interface with DTL as well as contribute to the hiring, training, and supervision of the teaching assistants (who will be all new for 2024).  The approximate time commitment is 10 hours per week. Some interactions with students may be required to be done online.

The course has been taught for several years.  The successful applicant will have the support of the co-instructor/course coordinator who teaches the yeast section for the last 6 weeks of the course, manages the Quercus course page and takes the lead on hiring/training TAs and dealing with course administrative issues.  As all of the TAs for MGY314 will be new for 2024, the instructor will be involved in recruiting, training and supporting the TAs in carrying out the bacterial genetics experiments.   A laboratory manual, course slides, pre-recorded lectures, lab report templates (and marking notes), examples of prior assessments and other critical components are available and have already been used successfully.  Reagents and equipment for each lab are overseen by the Dept of Teaching labs who may have questions about the materials and occasionally require help troubleshooting experimental issues.  Minimal modification of course materials may be required to update them for use this year or in response to specific student challenges (for instance, we’ve had to reteach M1V1 to the covid cohorts as well as provide additional support in helping students learn to use basic graphing/table making software for their reports).",Past teaching experience is the more relevant criterion than the need to acquire experience in respect of this posted position.,1,"Applicants will be considered on the basis of their practical familiarity with genetic analysis in model organisms as gained through some combination of coursework and research project work.

The projects available will range across the social and biophysical sciences; for example, experiments with agroecology and regenerative food systems, or engagement with food sovereignty movements and local food policies. Students will also have opportunities to reflect on the role of experiential learning, interdisciplinary community-engaged research, and action in effecting positive social and ecological change.","Experience (a) with research in critical food studies from interdisciplinary perspectives, (b) growing food, and (c) working with community partners and diverse social organizations an asset.",$51.93/hour + 4% vacation pay fall 2024; $52.97/hour + 4% vacation pay for winter 2025,,"Tutorials Thursday, 12 - 1"
